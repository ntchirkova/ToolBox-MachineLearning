1. The general trend is the more data is used to learn the more accurate the tests are.
2. The curve gets noisier as the percentage of data used increases, this may be because the percentage of data tested gets smaller.
3. With 90 trials the curve got even noisier. With 9 trials the curve was considerably less noisy.
4. Larger values of C seem to make the curve noisier while lower values seem to make it less noisy.
